# Profiles Rest Api 
This project is using Vagrant as its Image and DRF(Django Rest Framework) as its API.
It gives us the possibilities of making new and fresh profiles.   

*awesome* and **bold**


how to run this?


well 
first we need to download the vagrant server(ubuntu) 
so run 
'vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64'
and now we need to make the server come up 
simply put 
'vagrant up'
So far so good. 
now we need to connect to the server using ssh 
easily put 
'vagrant ssh'
now as you can see the terminal changed and now shows this 
Vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:~$
there you go the server is on!
