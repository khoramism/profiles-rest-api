# Profiles Rest Api 
## An authorization rest-api with simple and straightforward features. :)) !

### This project is using Vagrant as its Image and DRF(Django Rest Framework) as its API.


### how to run this?
<br>
<br>
#### first we need to download the vagrant server(ubuntu) so run 

<br>
  ``` vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64``` 
  <br>

#### and now we need to make the server come up simply put
<br>

  ``` vagrant up``` 
  <br>

##### So far so good. <br>
#### now we need to connect to the server using ssh.
<br>

  ``` vagrant ssh``` 
  <br>


now as you can see the terminal changed and now shows this ,there you go the server is on!
<br>
***Vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:~$***
<br>

#### In order to close the server type this on your terminal
```exit```
<br>
#### later if you want to run the server again you just need to ask for 
<br>

``` 
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
``` 
Have Fun!
